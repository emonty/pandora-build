Pandora-build is a set of autoconf macros and other tools intended to provide a
sane and correct autoconf build environment.

Currently, there are two ways to use it:

 a) installed on the system - everyone bulding from your VC will need an
    installed copy of pandora-build
 b) copied in to your project - copy the files from config/ and m4/ into your
    config/ and m4/ directories in your project

Known projects using pandora-build at the moment are:

  Drizzle
  Gearmand
  libdrizzle
  libmemcached
  vapour
  kimura
